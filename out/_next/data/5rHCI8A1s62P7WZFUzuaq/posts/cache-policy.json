The buffering provided by a cache benefits both latency and throughput.\n\n## Eviction Policies\n- Since we cannot cache all data we have, we need to discard some cache when out of space\n- We should consider what the cost is if we choose the policy\n- Eviction decisions should be done in an efficient manner, in order to avoid a situation in which the computation and space overheads required to answer these questions surpasses the benefit of using the cache\n- Hit rate, latency & space matter\n\n#### Examples\n- Least recently used (LRU): Discards the least recently used items first\n- Least frequently used (LFU): Discards data that was least frequently used\n- Segment LRU (SLRU):\n  - SLRU cache is divided into two segments, a probationary segment and a\nprotected segment\n  - Lines in each segment are ordered from the most to the least recently\naccessed\n  - Data from misses is added to the cache at the most recently accessed end of\nthe probationary segment\n  - Hits are removed from wherever they currently reside and added to the most\nrecently accessed end of the protected segment\n  - Lines in the protected segment have thus been accessed at least twice\n\n## Probability data structure\n\n#### Examples\n- Bloom Filter\n  - Pairwise independent hash functions\n  - Used to test whether an element is a member of a set\n  - Two result: \"possibly in set\" or \"definitely not in set\"\n  - isInSet(input) = (h1(input) and h2(input) and h3(input) ...)\n- Count-min Sketch\n  - Pairwise independent hash functions\n  - Used to count elements\n  - count(input) = min(h1(input), h2(input), h3(input), ...)\n\n## Admission policy\n- Hope to boost the effectiveness of caches\n- Given a newly accessed item and an eviction candidate from the cache, our\nscheme decides, based on the recent access history, whether it is worth\nadmitting the new item into the cache at the expense of the eviction candidate\n- An accessed item is only inserted into the cache if an admission policy\ndecides that the cache hit ratio is likely to benefit from replacing it with the\ncache victim\n\n### TinyLFU\nTinyLFU admission policy use Bloom Filter and Count-min Sketch to trace state of elements.\n![TinyLFU structure](cache-policy-pics/tinylfu.png)\n\nIf there is a new element insert event that makes the main cache(SLRU) discard its element, they will be compared with the\nstate of TinyLFU admission policy (Bloom Filter and Count-min Sketch).\n![TinyLFU with Main Cache](cache-policy-pics/tinylfu-2.png)\n\nFinally, for sparse bursts, the paper suggest a LRU as window cache.\n![W-TinyLFU](cache-policy-pics/w-tinylfu.png)\n\n## Reference\n- [Cache(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing))\n- [Cache replacement policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies)\n- [Caffeine wiki](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Efficiency)\n- [Window TinyLFU paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3149371)","excerpt":""},"previousPost":{"slug":"2021-march-note","frontmatter":{"title":"2021 March note","date":"March 27, 2021","description":"webrtc/linux/network reading"},"excerpt":"","content":" \n## 聲明\n我想筆記摘要是作給未來的自己用的，不過如果剛好有人看到我的筆記去讀原文的話，那是再好不過。<del>有人只看筆記不看課本的嗎</del>\n\n如果有錯也歡迎糾正，謝謝指教。\n\n## Reading\n- [Why video chat is a hard technical problem](https://dev.to/lazerwalker/why-video-chat-is-a-hard-technical-problem-43gj)\n  - 本文主要是開發 webrtc 會遇到的問題\n  - 瀏覽器支援不一\n  - 需要自己的後端並且可能需要面對過多 peer to peer 連線 ( Websocket -> STUN -> SFU)\n  - 應該也是因為這樣才會有第三方 SDK 在做這些事情吧\n- [TLS 1.3 / QUIC 與 HTTP/3 對效能的改善](https://hkt999.medium.com/tls-1-3-quic-%E8%88%87-http-3-%E5%B0%8D%E6%95%88%E8%83%BD%E7%9A%84%E6%94%B9%E5%96%84-a37b2ddcfc95)\n  - 本文主要是 QUIC 介紹\n  - [latency](https://www.igvita.com/2012/07/19/latency-the-new-web-performance-bottleneck) 影響\n  - 基於 UDP\n  - TLS 1.3 的 handshake 會先 Client HELLO (CHLO) 來節省 RTT\n  - QUIC 的 handshake 類似 TLS 1.3 ( inchoate CHLO 似乎有可能一次傳不完)\n  - 解決 TCP retransmission ambiguity problem\n  - 這個[pdf](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5072/v18/2018_jan25_quic_sferlin.pdf)有詳盡的介紹\n\n- [Persistent \"pipes\" in Linux](https://gist.github.com/CAFxX/571a1558db9a7b393579)\n  - persistent pipe ([pipe](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html) 為 Linux 重新導向資料的方法) \n  - hole punching 為 Linux [fallocate](https要://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html) 提供的特性，可以標注一個檔案哪段不要 (the logical size of the file does not change; only the physical size (the number of blocks) may change)\n  - 利用這個特性把檔案當作 queue 來使用且 lseek 可以跳過 hole\n\n- [Why kafka is so fast](https://medium.com/swlh/why-kafka-is-so-fast-bde0d987cd03)\n  - 實時並不代表快，而是可預測\n  - 針對吞吐量去最佳化\n  - log-structured -> append-only log -> sequential 很多系統也都採用，有興趣可參考[此書](https://www.databass.dev)\n  - record batch 像 [redis pipeline](https://redis.io/topics/pipelining) 一樣，遇到網路問題的話還是要為了減少 RTT 還做 batch\n  - cheap consumers 不移除 message 而是增加 offset，並依靠之前的 sequential read\n  - unflushed buffered writes 不會 fsync -> \\\n  disk-backed in-memory queue ->\\\n  一個 ack 的 write 並不代表 durability ->\\\n  用 replica 來 cover\n  - \n- RCU\n  - [Linux 核心設計: RCU 同步機制](https://hackmd.io/@sysprog/linux-rcu)\n  - [What is RCU, Fundamentally?](http://lwn.net/Articles/262464/)\n  - [What is RCU?
